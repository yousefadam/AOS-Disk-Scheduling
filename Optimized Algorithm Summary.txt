the idea of the optimized algorithm is to process all the requests though only a single disk traversal.
- The request queue is sorted ascendingly based the request's position.
- The algorithms starts at 0, the disk beginning.
- Then the head traverses through the disk once,
processing all the requests and stop right after the last request, with the largest position.
